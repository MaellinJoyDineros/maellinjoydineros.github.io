## Fun Facts About Me:

-   I have two gray kittens and two Maltese Poodles!

-   I love puzzles. I do not mind being called "boring" when I choose to play puzzle games to "de-stress."

-   I can finish any mystery/romance book in a day. My current favorite romance book is "Love & Words" by Christina Lauren and mystery book is "The Killing Game" by Iris Johansen.

-   I would rather sing in front of hundreds of strangers than anyone important to me.

-   My most favorite purchase of the year is a wet vacuum by BISSELL. It is both a solids vacuum and a mop and saves me time from doing two passes of my entire house!
