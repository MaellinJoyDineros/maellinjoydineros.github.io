## Fun Facts About Me:

-   My whole family immigrated from the Philippines to USA in 2011. As a 12-year-old I went to middle school for 3 weeks (even went to grad-night) and graduated!
-   I love puzzles. I do not mind being called "boring" when I choose to play puzzle games to "de-stress."
-   I can finish any mystery/romance book in a day. My current favorite romance book is "Love & Words" by Christina Lauren and mystery book is "The Killing Game" by Iris Johansen.
-   I would rather sing in front of hundreds of strangers than anyone important to me.
-   I have two gray kittens and two Maltese Poodles! My cats are named Sky and Mittens (he looks like he's wearing socks!) and my dogs are named Mikmik and Potchi (after Filipino sweet snacks).
-   My most favorite purchase of the year is a wet vacuum by BISSELL. It is both a solids vacuum and a mop and saves me time from doing two passes of my entire house!
