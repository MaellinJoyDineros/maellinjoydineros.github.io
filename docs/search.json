    "text": "I have two gray kittens and two Maltese Poodles!\nI love puzzles. I do not mind being called “boring” when I choose to play puzzle games to “de-stress.”\nI can finish any mystery/romance book in a day. My current favorite romance book is “Love & Words” by Christina Lauren and mystery book is “The Killing Game” by Iris Johansen.\nI would rather sing in front of hundreds of strangers than anyone important to me.\nMy most favorite purchase of the year is a wet vacuum by BISSELL. It is both a solids vacuum and a mop and saves me time from doing two passes of my entire house!\n\n\n\nemail: maellin02@gmail.com"
